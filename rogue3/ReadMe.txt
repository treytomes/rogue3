    rogue3 Project Overview
========================================================================

The goal of this project is to create a very small mini-roguelike game.

It will have 21 levels (a town level, plus 20 dungeon levels).  The goal is, basically, to get to the bottom level and back up again.

You start at level 0, in the town, where you find that the town is being overrun by rat infestation.
You play the role of the local rat catcher, hired to locate and remove the source of the infestation.

At the bottom level of the dungeon is the rat king, who has been organizing the efforts of the lesser rats.
